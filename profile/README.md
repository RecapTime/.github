# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're Recap Time, formerly known as [The Pins Team](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub), where we build open-source tools and we're behind [Verification Process Endpoint](https://recaptime.gitlab.io/verify) (an project to confirm/verify users the open-source and transparent way and to find any possible alternative accounts), Community Lores (documentation arc for our projects and the home of Hermitcraft Video Transcripts used in the unofficial Hermitcraft Recap podcast) and Gitpodified Workspace Images (opinionated Gitpod workspace images based on upstream, with sprinkles and even more choices).

Currently, [we do an newsletter (aka run our own open-source blog)](https://gitlab.com/RecapTime/newsletter) where we draft and publish our stuff on
Medium and DevTo, but we have other sutff sadly to do.

## Follow us

* Twitter: [@RecapTime](https://twitter.com/RecapTime)
* DevTo: <https://dev.to/RecapTime>

## Meet The Team

Intrested in making it possible? Consider [joining the squad](https://go.rtapp.tk/join-squad) and make that happen. We're not an company yet,
but atleast we're setting up our online presence for the future.

### Supporting us finanically

We think we want to be independent from privacy-invading ads, but this might make us out of the business. Maintaining open-source projects take time
and resources, so if you want to help us keep afloat, we'll setup our donation page soon. Thanks for giving us some coffee in advance!

* Links coming soon!

  <summary>Why you got an rebrand?</summary>
  
  We rebranded from The Pins Team to Recap Time Squad not only because our old domain, `madebythepins.tk`, got hijacked with domain parking with ad cringe. Second, we'll go on full gear
  on the development on that fediverse superapp soon.
