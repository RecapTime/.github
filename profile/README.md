# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're Recap Time, an division here at [The Pins Team](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub), where we'll build an future platform with
ActivityPub and Matrix specs as first-class citizens, fully open-sourced. It's still under Andrei Jiroh's Ideas List yet, so it maybe expected
to be stable roughly 10-15 years from now.

In meanwhile, we'll build tools as we make our own platform possible in the future, including:

* [Verification Process Endpoint](https://recaptime.gitlab.io/verify) - An project for platforms to add verified badges to authentic users without the
hassle of manually verify their identity and other stuff on your own.

Currently, [we do an newsletter (aka run our own open-source blog)](https://gitlab.com/RecapTime/newsletter) where we draft and publish our stuff on
Medium and DevTo, but we have other sutff sadly to do.

## Meet The Team

Intrested in making it possible? Consider [joining The Pins Team](https://recaptime.gitlab.io/join) and make that happen. We're not an company yet,
but atleast we're setting up our online presence for the future.

### Supporting us finanically

We think we want to be independent from privacy-invading ads, but this might make us out of the business. Maintaining open-source projects take time
and resources, so if you want to help us keep afloat, we'll setup our donation page soon. Thanks for giving us some coffee in advance!
